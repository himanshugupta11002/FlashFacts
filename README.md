**FAKE NEWS DETECTOR**

I've developed a fake news detector using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web apps. The app utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text content and determine the likelihood of it being fake news. It incorporates a machine learning model trained on a dataset of both real and fake news articles. Users can input text or URLs, and the app provides a prediction on the authenticity of the information. The backend is powered by Python libraries such as NLTK, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for NLP and machine learning tasks.

How to run:
1. set up the project environment
2. Download necesarry libraries
3. run the tokenizer.py file to get the tensors of the data
4. save the tokenize data file in the project folder itself
5. run the main .py file to train the model
6. save the .h5 file in the project itself
7. run the app.py file to get the streamlit app link

   
Thank you for review
